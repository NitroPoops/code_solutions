## Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number

**Medium**

Given an integer `num`, return _three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that **sum** to_ `num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return _an **empty** array_.

**Example 1:**

    Input: num = 33
    Output: [10,11,12]
    Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
    10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].

**Example 2:**

    Input: num = 4
    Output: []
    Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= num <= 1015`
